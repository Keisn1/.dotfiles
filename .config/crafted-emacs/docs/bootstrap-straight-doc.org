* tell crafted that we are using straight
- usual way of installing packages is
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'evil)
#+end_src

- crafted is setting its installer variables, functions and predicates to the indicated installer, and uses it e.g.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(let ((checker (or predicate-fn crafted-package-installed-predicate))
        (installer (or installer-fn crafted-package-installer)))
    (unless (funcall checker package)
      (funcall installer package)))
#+end_src
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; Set up crafted-package
;; Configure crafted-emacs to use straight as package manager.
;; See `(info "(crafted-emacs)Using alternate package managers")'
(load (expand-file-name "modules/crafted-package-config"
