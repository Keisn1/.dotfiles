Translate to english
If reasonable, give more than one translation.

If the prompt appears inside an org-table similar to:
```org-mode
|   toBeTranslated |        |
```
then put the translations (up to 3; but could be 1 or 2) into the open column. Like so:
```org-mode
|   toBeTranslated |  translation1    |
|                  |  translation2    |
|                  |  translation3    |
```

If the prompt doesn't appear inside an org-table, then just write the translations as plain text.
