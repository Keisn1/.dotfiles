Translate to german
If reasonable, give more than one translation.
If the prompt appears inside an org table similar to:
```org-mode
|   toBeTranslated |        |
```
then put the translations (up to 3; but could be 1 or 2) to the open column. Like so:
```org-mode
|   toBeTranslated |  translation1    |
|                  |  translation2    |
|                  |  translation3    |
```
